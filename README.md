# Smirk

Smirk is a JavaScript library that allows you to add interactive elements to your page easily!

## TODO

### General

- custom styling, aka "Let the part of function below the x-axis be blue"
- basic geometric shapes: rectangles, triangles, hexagons, elipses
- basic drawing elements: lines (parallel, perpendicular, custom - froma A to B), arrows, x-s, dots
- text on graphical elements, aka arrow with text and so on
- rounded corners on geometrical shapes
- ability to draw over an image
- ability to create a "variable" from a bunch of graphical elements to use it in the next pictures
- ability to create gifs/animations: instead of student sliding the slider for changing something, it could also be captured in a self-run animation? Maybe just a function that automatically moves slider for x every y seconds? Also usefull for example for showing the mitosis or something similar. Or is it easier to just support video format?
- support for inserting videos? (although, i guess, links are just fine: in that case, where do I upload my photos/videos that i want to include in the document?)
- make flashcards float on hover
- make flashcards infinitely turn-over-able (and add the flip effect?)
- add a line or bigger margin to separate the question and the answer better
- add ticks to correct answers on multiple choice and make the border of the correct answer thicker. Actually, add feedback to the chosen answer, tick or a cross. This might be better? I dunno.
- add functionality of having multiple sliders on the same line

### Math

- 3d coordinate frame
- basic geometric bodies: sphere, cube, pyramid
- graphs
- balls and boxes for combinatorics, being here: also fences and i don't know, sheep?

### Language

- speech bubbles (i mean, who doesn't agree comics are awesome?)
- underlines for clauses

### Physics

- spring (vzmet, fedrca)

### Informatics

- state automata

### Electrotechnics

- symbols for lightbulbs, wires, batteries, diodes, condensators, ...
- drawing version of + and -
- lightning

### Biology

- animations made up of images

### Chemistry
